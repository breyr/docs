## Welcome to My CKAD Study Notes

This is my personal collection of study notes for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. While this site is primarily for my own reference, it’s publicly accessible, so feel free to browse through the content if you find it helpful.

These notes are a work in progress and reflect my journey in mastering Kubernetes. Happy studying!

This version reflects that it’s for personal use but is still open to others if they happen to find it.
